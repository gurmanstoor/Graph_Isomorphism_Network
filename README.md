Exploring a newer GNN architecture called Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN)

The Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) model, a kind of Graph Neural Network
(GNN) created to address the challenging issue of evaluating whether two graphs
are structurally equivalent, is evaluated in this research. The GIN model is a very
expressive and potent architecture that outperforms many other existing models
by applying two different types of aggregation functions on the feature vectors
of nodes and their neighbours.
